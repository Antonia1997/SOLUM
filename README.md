# SOLUM
The SOLUM project is a generative plant-based music paired with audio-sensitive visuals to create an audio-visual experience that aims to demonstrate the reactive nature of plants. This shall be achieved by continuing and expanding upon an earlier, similar project named ANIMA. Both the ANIMA and SOLUM projects utilise electrode pads attached to the leaves of a plant, being analysed by both the Arduino and Pure Data coding programmes, to produce sounds of a musical nature.
